Fourth year DPhil student at the University of Oxford working under the supervision of [Martin Bridson](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/bridson/).\
I am a Clarendon Scholar and the recipient of the John Moussouris scholarship in mathematics (through Merton College).\
I completed my master's degree at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem under the supervision of [Zlil Sela](http://www.ma.huji.ac.il/~zlil/). 

My research is in **geometric group theory** and my work explores connections between geometry, topology and profinite rigidity. \
I am also interested in model theory and mathematical logic (mostly from a group theoretic point of view). 

## **Research papers:**
>Characterising surface groups by their virtual second betti number, *with an appendix by [Ismael Morales](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/ismael.morales)*. \
Preprint [(arXiv:2209.14925)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14925)

>Limit groups over coherent right-angled Artin groups are cyclic subgroup separable. \
To appear in the *Michigan Mathematical Journal* [(arXiv:2101.10458)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.10458)

>Formal solutions and the first-order theory of acylindrically hyperbolic groups, *with [Simon Andr√©](http://perso.eleves.ens-rennes.fr/~sandre/anglais.html)*. \
*Journal of the London Mathematical Society* **105**-2 (2022), 1012-1072 [(open access)](https://londmathsoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1112/jlms.12526)

## **Teaching:**
- I am a Stipendiary Lecturer in Pure Mathematics at Exeter College (University of Oxford), teaching A2: Metric Spaces and Complex Analysis in Michaelmas '22-23. 

- I was a tutor and a TA at the University of Oxford, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and Reichman University (IDC Herzliya) teaching linear algebra, discrete mathematics, general topology, set theory, mathematical logic, infinite groups, geometry of surfaces, group theory and integration.

I am also interested in insects, arachnids, reptiles and other small animals. I keep a colony of short-fingered sand geckos (*Stenodactylus sthenodactylus*) and take pictures of insects when the weather is nice.
