Fourth year DPhil student at the University of Oxford working under the supervision of [Martin Bridson](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/bridson/).\
I am a Clarendon Scholar and the recipient of the John Moussouris scholarship in mathematics (through Merton College).\
I completed my master's degree at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem under the supervision of [Zlil Sela](http://www.ma.huji.ac.il/~zlil/). 

My research is in **geometric group theory** and my work explores connections between geometry, topology and profinite rigidity. \
I am also interested in model theory and mathematical logic (mostly from a group theoretic point of view).

## **Teaching:**
- I am a Stipendiary Lecturer in Pure Mathematics at Exeter College (University of Oxford), teaching A2: Metric Spaces and Complex Analysis in Michaelmas '22-23. 

- I was a tutor and a TA at the University of Oxford, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and Reichman University (IDC Herzliya) teaching linear algebra, discrete mathematics, general topology, set theory, mathematical logic, infinite groups, geometry of surfaces, group theory and integration.

I enjoy when mathematics and visual arts come together and in '20-21 I volunteered with [Multaka](https://www.torch.ox.ac.uk/multaka-oxford) and co-produced the *Precious and Rare: Islamic Metalwork from The Courtauld* exhibition at the History of Science in Oxford. \
I made a short [animated video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-zgMIAfFEo) for the exhibition, and you can see me talking about it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYVnhWB8yEQ). I also made a computer programme for generating symmetric patterns inspired by Islamic art:

I am also interested in insects, arachnids, reptiles and other small animals. I keep a colony of short-fingered sand geckos (*Stenodactylus sthenodactylus*) and dabble at macro photography.
